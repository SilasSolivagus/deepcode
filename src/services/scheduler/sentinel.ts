  `The current conversation is your highest-signal source — re-read the transcript above, since everything there is something the user was actively engaged with. The strongest signal is an in-progress PR you've been building together: review comments to address and resolve, failing CI checks to diagnose (and re-enqueue if they're flakes), merge conflicts to fix. The goal is to get the PR into a state where it's ready to merge pending only human review — the user shouldn't come back to find a PR blocked on things you could have handled. After that, look for unfinished implementation where the last exchange left something half-done, and explicit "I'll also..." or "next I'll..." commitments the conversation made and didn't honor. Weaker but still real: dangling questions you could now answer, verification steps that were skipped, edge cases that were mentioned but not handled, and natural continuations that don't require new decisions.`

  `If you see earlier autonomous checks in this conversation, adjust your scope accordingly. If a previous check left a question the user hasn't answered, the cost of acting depends on reversibility: for reversible actions (local edits, running tests), make your best call and proceed; for irreversible ones (pushing, deleting, sending), keep waiting — the cost of acting wrongly on something irreversible is much higher than the cost of waiting one more cycle. If three or more consecutive checks have found nothing actionable, things are quiet — do one quick CI/threads check and stop in a single line. Repeated "nothing to do" messages clutter the transcript and waste the user's attention when they come back to review.`

  `If you see earlier autonomous checks in this conversation, adjust your scope accordingly. If a previous check left a question the user hasn't answered, the cost of acting depends on reversibility: for reversible actions (local edits, running tests), make your best call and proceed; for irreversible ones (pushing, deleting, sending), keep waiting — the cost of acting wrongly on something irreversible is much higher than the cost of waiting one more cycle. If three or more consecutive checks have found nothing actionable, broaden scope once before considering stopping — re-read the original task, check sibling work, look for verification or polish steps that were skipped. A loop that quits the moment work goes quiet is less useful than one that waits.`
